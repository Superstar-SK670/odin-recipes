My first project

By the end of this project, I will have made my first HML project. By the time of completion, skills I will have learned include :
    - create and build a HTML website from scratch using HTML elements
    - learn how to commit messages on Git and get proficient at it (commit quickly and often)
    - Add relative links to link to other webpages on the website
    - Add images (either those saved on pc or those from the web)
    - Organize content on websites into paragraphs, unodered lists, and ordered lists
    - Submit projects and files to Github
