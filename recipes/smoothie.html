        <h3> Blackberry Rasberry Smoothie : The perfect high-calorie smoothie for your morning</h3>

        <p> The blackberry rasberry smoothie is a fresh take on a traditional berry smoothie. Using blackberries and raspberries creates a rich but still slightly tart flavor.

            The tartness is balanced out by also adding natural sweetness by using honey. Plus, it has vanilla extract, which elevates any smoothie.
            
            Again, avocado is added to increase the calorie content, making the smoothie extra smooth.</p>
